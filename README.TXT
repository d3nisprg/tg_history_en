"So, many of group members took part in VSosh. Since all or allmost are region winners they have auto passage on it. Then let's start right away with it. So in this message I'll try to give u the most usefull advices for region olympiad.

1. Very important is to buy correct chocolate/drinks. When I go without snacks on open olympiad in 2019 I took ~200 place. However having come in 2020 with liter of "Milk wonder" + "Mars" bar I entered top 40. Then I recommend to buy:
Milkshake "Milk wonder" (helped at first round of open olympiad), milkshake from kfc (helped at second round of open olympiad), chocolate "Russia-generous soul" with caramel (helped at first round of ROI), litr of apple&cherry juice "Sady Pridoniya" (helped on region, I drank it at first and second round). If we're talking about regional stage then better is to take apple&cherry juice, because u never know how properties changes in different olympiad.
In second round of ROI I ate "Ritter sport" chocolate bar with milky flavor and totaly losed. I don't recommed it.

2.Remember the main rule "A, B, C - full, D - subgroups". It means that on two rounds u have to pass A, B, C problems at full points and try to pass problem D at maximum points. Then in summ u will have more than 630 points. (It is auto passage on VseRos)

3. Try to relax before round...

4. Let's say u're sitting on the 4th hour and u can't pass even pass problem A. Then hit the table hard and say "EASY". Other members will think that u pass all the problems, that they lose and in fact due the stress will lose. This way u will make appearance that u are very cool, like cats stretchs out to appear that they are taller in fight.

ATTENTION: if u are not sure that u bought correct chocolate/milkshake it will better to ask me in personal chat. It's better to check all for 100 times than stay with out 100 thousent and auto passage to ROI later."
